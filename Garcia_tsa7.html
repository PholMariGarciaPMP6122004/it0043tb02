                <p>In Nazarick, Albedo lays in Ainz's bed and reflects on her conflict, loving Momonga while serving
                    Ainz, but resolves to continue serving him. In E-Rantel, Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown reads in bed
                    before noticing the risen sun through the closed curtain window. Ready for a new day, Foire stands
                    and leaves to give her duty shift relief report to Fith, while Ainz exchanges his book for another
                    and ponders telling his minions if he wants to view them as equals. However, he decides to table
                    that notion for another day as his maids exchange shifts. With Fith now attending him, Ainz permits
                    her to dress him and she adorns him in a red cloak with gold adornments with gemstone accents-- much
                    to Ainz's quiet embarrassment.</p>

                    alt="Episode 2">
                <p>At night, Ainz Ooal Gown reflects on how he wishes to rule his Sorcerer Kingdom, pondering words
                    possibly once said by Ulbert. Fith notices his distracted mind, and he stands up to also muse about
                    Demiurge and Albedo's world conquest scheme they "inferred" from his past actions. Opening a window,
                    Ainz feels making the nation a utopia for all races would likely bring peace and lead any of his
                    friends in the New World to him. As he sighs, unsure to tell his guardians, Fith misunderstands and
                    apologetically prostrates, thinking she possibly failed Ainz on her shift.

                    In Re-Estize, Renner finishes a book reading at a newly opened orphanage before being escorted by
                    Climb with Blue Roses members, Evileye and Tina. Explaining how she funded the orphanage, Renner
                    claims the strong must save the weak, sending Climb to his memory of her rescuing him from poverty.
                    Finding that the orphanage will reduce crime among the orphaned youths, it also grants jobs to war
                    widows following the Massacre at Katze Plains. Renner also states that should some orphans be found
                    to have talent, other nobles may also invest, something Evileye can pragmatically agree on. Renner
                    elaborates that Brain Unglaus gave her the idea as he seeks pupils for his swordsmanship to combat
                    the Sorcerer King one day. As Renner requests to know Evileye's hidden talent, the adventurer yells
                    in a retort, sending Renner into Climb's lap in fright.

                    After a euphemism on Climb spoiling Renner, Evileye explains all talents are different, like Lakyus,
                    whose power contains the evil within her Sword, which can level a city. Considering Lakyus's
                    absence, Climb asks about her whereabouts, and Tina answers that she's training Tia and Gagaran back
                    to their prior strength, having lost life force from resurrection after their encounter with
                    Jaldabaoth. Noting they cannot match the demon, Tina's mention of Momon sends Evileye into a swoon
                    as she advertises his incredible strength but laments he serves the Sorcerer King. Tina asks Evileye
                    if she has a chance to kill the undead king, but she finds it impossible considering the rumors and
                    believes Momon is the only one capable.</p>

                <p>As Albedo prepares to leave for the Re-Estize Kingdom, Ainz asks her to be wary as Shalltear's
                    attackers are still unknown and goes over if she has her countermeasures readied. But transitioning
                    to the topic of Demiurge, Ainz stops himself as he doesn't want to ruin his "Overlord" persona to
                    his NPC, then asks Albedo to be careful of common illnesses in the New World even though she is
                    immune to sickness. Although acknowledging, Albedo still asks for a kiss as she claims it can boost
                    immunity and lists more reasons for that. As she puckers up, he kisses her on the cheek, but she
                    starts crying as he indulges her request, so he hugs her to calm her down. Once she apologizes for
                    her scene, Ainz understands and wishes her safe travels as she says goodbye to "Lord Momonga." After
                    Albedo drives out of sight, Ainz orders Lumière to forget everything she witnessed from the
                    farewell, with the maid acknowledging the command.
                    In the Slane Theocracy, the Six Cardinals conduct a meeting over the founding of the Sorcerer
                    Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown, led by Cardinal Raymond Zarg Lauransan. As the Baharuth Empire recognizes
                    the Sorcerer Kingdom, Cardinal Dominic Ihre Partouche voices that an undead ruler is a hell-on-earth
                    situation as Cardinal Yvon Jasna Delacroix asks if they should have intervened sooner. Still,
                    Cardinal Berenice Nagua Santini voices they chose not to antagonize Gown at the time. Cardinal
                    Maximilian Oreio Lagier asks about the Empire's reasons as they could be enthralled, but Cardinal
                    Zinedine Delan Guelfi refutes the notion as the Empire has Paradyne. Raymond notes that Thousand
                    Leagues Astrologer remotely observed the war and gave a delayed report and are stunned to learn Ainz
                    commanded 500 Death Knights during the war and now in E-Rantel. As Raymond was once Third Seat of
                    Black Scripture, he does not believe humans could fight Death Knights while God-kins are more
                    likely-- such as Extra Seat of the Black Scripture and the Captain of the Black Scripture.</p>

                <p>The Sunlight Scripture, led by Nigun Grid Luin prepares to attack Carne Village and kill Gazef
                    Stronoff. When Carne Village is surrounded, Gazef requests Ainz Ooal Gown to protect the village
                    once more, knowing that it is a selfish request. However, Ainz agrees due to his respect for him and
                    hands him a souvenir sculpture as a gift which confuses Gazef. Gazef and his troops valiantly
                    attempt to save the villagers from the fighting. Gazef uses his martial arts against the angels but
                    he becomes overwhelmed by their magic, resulting in all his troops dead or unable to fight. Nigun
                    tells Gazef that he should abandon the villagers and save his own life. Instead, Gazef taunts Nigun
                    by telling him that someone in the village is stronger than he is. Nigun thinks he's bluffing and
                    orders his angels to finish Gazef off. However, just before he is killed, he is suddenly teleported
                    along with his men to the village storage house. Gazef notices that the sculpture has vanished from
                    his hand, now realizing that he was saved by none other than Ainz.
                    Ainz confronts the Sunlight Scripture and requests them to surrender or face the consequences. Ainz
                    uses Negative Burst on the Archangel Flame and uses Hell Flame on the Principality Observation.
                    Nigun becomes desperate and uses the sealing crystal which summons the Dominion Authority. Ainz
                    feels utterly disappointed at even his strongest angel, showing it in his expression. Nigun thinks
                    Ainz is joking and orders the Dominion Authority to attack but it does the slightest damage to him.
                    Albedo gets mad and curses this lower life form of hurting her beloved. Ainz calms Albedo down and
                    uses Black Hole on the Dominion Authority. Nigun begins to beg for his life but he is turned down by
                    Ainz and Albedo. The remaining members face the consequences of their foolishness.
                    Ainz easily defeats the Sunlight Scripture and returns to Nazarick. He announces and orders his NPCs
                    to spread his name to the New World while his servants misinterpret his declaration and prepare for
                    their own plan on taking over their world.</p>
